"""Faithfulness and hallucination detection rail.

This module evaluates whether a generated answer is supported by the retrieved
context. It uses NeMo-style self-check prompts and optional claim-level scoring,
plus a lightweight deterministic check for obvious hallucinations (e.g., years
or large numbers not present in evidence).

Requirements references (from internal docs): REQ-501 through REQ-505.
