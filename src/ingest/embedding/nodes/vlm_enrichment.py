"""Post-chunking VLM image enrichment node for the Embedding Pipeline.

This node runs after ``chunking_node`` and replaces ``![alt](src)`` image
placeholder patterns in chunk text with VLM-generated descriptions.

Architectural note
------------------
- ``vlm_mode="builtin"``: Docling's SmolVLM generates figure descriptions at
  parse time, already embedded in the ``DoclingDocument`` before chunking.
  This node is a **no-op** for that mode.
- ``vlm_mode="external"``: This node performs the VLM API calls via LiteLLM
  router for each image placeholder found in chunk text.
- ``vlm_mode="disabled"``: This node is a **no-op**.

All per-chunk failures are non-fatal; the original chunk text is preserved
on any error. The node itself never raises.
