"""ColQwen2 model adapter for visual embedding pipeline.

This module provides a minimal adapter around the ColQwen2 model to produce
128-dim patch-level visual embeddings from document page images. It handles
model lifecycle (load with 4-bit quantization, batch inference, GPU memory
release) for downstream visual embedding ingestion nodes.
