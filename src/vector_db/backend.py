"""VectorBackend — abstract base class for all vector store backends.

Defines the formal contract between the ingestion/retrieval pipelines and
any vector store implementation. All collection-scoped operations accept an
optional ``collection`` parameter; passing ``None`` uses the backend's
configured default. New backends implement the abstract methods;
``close_client`` is overridden only when the backend requires explicit teardown.
