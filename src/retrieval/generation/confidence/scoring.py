"""Pure utility functions for composite confidence scoring.

All functions are deterministic, side-effect-free, and require no I/O.
They implement the 3-signal confidence model from the retrieval spec:

  composite = (W_r * retrieval) + (W_l * llm) + (W_c * citation)

Default weights are read from config (see config/settings.py).
