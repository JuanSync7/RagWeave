  composite < high, retries left  -> RE_RETRIEVE
  retries exhausted, c >= low     -> FLAG

    The routing table balances answer quality against latency:
    - High confidence answers are returned immediately.
    - Medium or low confidence triggers one re-retrieval attempt with
      broader search parameters before falling back to FLAG or BLOCK.

    Args:
        composite: Composite confidence score in [0.0, 1.0]. Must be a
            finite float; NaN is treated as a safe-fail BLOCK.
        retry_count: Number of re-retrieval attempts already made.
        high_threshold: Score at or above which answers are returned.
            Default 0.70.
        low_threshold: Score below which answers are blocked after
            exhausting retries. Default 0.50.
        max_retries: Maximum number of re-retrieval attempts. Default 1.

    Returns:
        PostGuardrailAction indicating what to do with the answer.
