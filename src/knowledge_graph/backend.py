"""GraphStorageBackend — abstract base class for all KG storage backends.

Defines the formal contract between the knowledge-graph pipeline and any
storage implementation.  New backends implement all abstract methods; the
four concrete helper methods (``get_all_entities``,
``get_all_node_names_and_aliases``, ``get_outgoing_edges``,
``get_incoming_edges``) may be overridden for efficiency but have sensible
default implementations.
