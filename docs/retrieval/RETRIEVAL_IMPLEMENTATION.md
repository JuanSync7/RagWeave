> **Document intent:** This file is a phased implementation plan tied to `RETRIEVAL_SPEC.md`.  
> It is not the source of truth for current runtime behavior.  
> For as-built behavior, refer to `docs/retrieval/RETRIEVAL_ENGINEERING_GUIDE.md`, `src/retrieval/README.md`, and `server/README.md`.

This document provides a phased implementation plan and detailed code appendix for the retrieval pipeline specified in `RETRIEVAL_SPEC.md`. Every task references the requirements it satisfies.

# Part A: Task-Oriented Overview

## Phase 1 — Core Pipeline Hardening

Foundation work: guardrails, validation, and resilience. These tasks make the pipeline safe before adding new capabilities.

### Task 1.1: Pre-Retrieval Guardrail Layer

**Description:** Build a guardrail module that sits between query processing and retrieval. It validates inputs, detects injection, classifies risk, and optionally filters PII from the query.

**Requirements Covered:** REQ-201, REQ-202, REQ-203, REQ-204, REQ-205, REQ-903

**Dependencies:** None — this is a new module.

**Complexity:** M

**Subtasks:**

1. Define a `GuardrailResult` data structure (pass/reject, risk level, sanitized query, PII detections)
2. Implement input validation (query length, parameter ranges, filter sanitization)
3. Load injection patterns from external YAML config file
4. Implement risk classifier with externalized keyword taxonomy
5. Implement conditional PII filtering (gated on `EXTERNAL_LLM_MODE` config flag)
6. Wire into the pipeline between query processing and retrieval

---

### Task 1.2: Post-Generation Guardrail Layer

**Description:** Build a guardrail module that sits between generation and answer delivery. It computes confidence, detects hallucination, filters PII from the answer, sanitizes output, and routes based on confidence + risk.

**Requirements Covered:** REQ-701, REQ-702, REQ-703, REQ-704, REQ-705, REQ-706

**Dependencies:** Task 2.1 (confidence scoring logic), Task 2.3 (risk classification — shared with Task 1.1)

**Complexity:** L

**Subtasks:**

1. Define a `PostGuardrailResult` data structure (action: return/re-retrieve/flag, redacted answer, confidence breakdown)
2. Implement PII detection on generated answer (regex + optional NER)
3. Implement output sanitization (system prompt leak detection, artifact stripping)
4. Implement risk-based output filtering for HIGH risk queries (numerical claim verification)
5. Implement confidence routing logic (threshold-based, with single re-retrieval retry)
6. Wire into the pipeline between generation and answer delivery

---

### Task 1.3: Retry Logic for External LLM Calls

**Description:** Add exponential backoff retry wrapper for all external LLM calls (query reformulation, confidence evaluation, answer generation). Include graceful fallback when all retries are exhausted.

**Requirements Covered:** REQ-605, REQ-902

**Dependencies:** None.

**Complexity:** S

**Subtasks:**

1. Implement a generic retry decorator/wrapper with configurable max retries, base interval, and max backoff
2. Apply to query processing LLM calls (reformulation, evaluation)
3. Apply to generation LLM call
4. Define fallback behavior for each call site (heuristic confidence, skip generation, etc.)
5. Externalize retry parameters to config (REQ-903)

---

### Task 1.4: Input Validation at System Boundaries

**Description:** Add validation for all external inputs that flow into the retrieval pipeline: search parameters, metadata filters, and query content.

**Requirements Covered:** REQ-201, REQ-903

**Dependencies:** None. Can be implemented within Task 1.1 or as a standalone utility.

**Complexity:** S

**Subtasks:**

1. Define valid ranges for `alpha` (0.0–1.0), `search_limit` (1–100), `rerank_top_k` (1–50)
2. Sanitize metadata filter values (prevent Weaviate query language injection)
3. Validate query length (min/max configurable)
4. Return structured error responses for invalid inputs (not exceptions)

---

## Phase 2 — Confidence & Routing

The intelligence layer: composite scoring, risk-aware routing, and full-pipeline orchestration.

### Task 2.1: 3-Signal Confidence Scoring

**Description:** Implement the composite confidence score that combines retrieval confidence (reranker scores), LLM self-reported confidence, and citation coverage into a single 0.0–1.0 score.

**Requirements Covered:** REQ-701, REQ-604

**Dependencies:** REQ-403 (reranker score thresholds — already exists), REQ-604 (LLM confidence extraction)

**Complexity:** M

**Subtasks:**

1. Implement retrieval confidence calculation (top-3 reranker score average)
2. Implement LLM confidence extraction and parsing (high/medium/low → numerical with downward correction)
3. Implement citation coverage calculation (sentence-level grounding check)
4. Implement weighted combination with configurable weights
5. Externalize weights and threshold values to config (REQ-903)

---

### Task 2.2: Full-Pipeline LangGraph Routing

**Description:** Extend the existing LangGraph workflow from query-processing-only to wrap the entire pipeline. Add conditional routing based on composite confidence: return answer, re-retrieve with broader parameters, or flag for review.

**Requirements Covered:** REQ-706, REQ-902

**Dependencies:** Task 2.1 (confidence scoring), Task 1.1 (pre-retrieval guardrail), Task 1.2 (post-generation guardrail)

**Complexity:** L

**Subtasks:**

1. Define `RAGPipelineState` TypedDict covering all pipeline stages (query, transformed query, retrieved docs, ranked docs, formatted context, answer, confidence, risk level, retry count)
2. Define graph nodes for each pipeline stage (transform → guardrail → retrieve → rerank → format → generate → evaluate → route)
3. Implement conditional edges from evaluate node (return / re-retrieve / flag)
4. Implement re-retrieval with broader parameters (increased top-k, lower alpha toward BM25, relaxed filters)
5. Enforce single retry limit (retry_count < 1)
6. Wire human review / escalation node for flagged queries

---

### Task 2.3: Risk Classification

**Description:** Implement deterministic keyword-based risk classification for queries. HIGH risk queries trigger additional verification in the post-generation guardrail.

**Requirements Covered:** REQ-203, REQ-705, REQ-903

**Dependencies:** None — standalone classifier.

**Complexity:** S

**Subtasks:**

1. Define risk taxonomy (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW keyword lists) in external config file
2. Implement classifier: scan query for keyword matches, return highest matching level
3. Attach risk level to pipeline state for downstream use
4. Ensure taxonomy config is reloadable on restart

---

## Phase 3 — Retrieval Quality

Improve the quality of what gets retrieved and how it's presented to the LLM.

### Task 3.1: Structured Document Formatter

**Description:** Replace the current simple chunk formatting with structured metadata attachment. Each chunk injected into the LLM context must carry filename, version, date, domain, section, and spec ID.

**Requirements Covered:** REQ-501, REQ-503

**Dependencies:** Metadata schema must be populated at ingestion time (out of scope, but formatter must handle missing fields gracefully).

**Complexity:** S

**Subtasks:**

1. Define the formatted chunk template (metadata header + content body)
2. Implement formatter function that maps document metadata to the template
3. Handle missing metadata fields (default to "unknown")
4. Number chunks sequentially in the context string
5. Ensure format is deterministic

---

### Task 3.2: Version Conflict Detection

**Description:** Detect when retrieved documents share the same specification ID or filename stem but differ in version. Flag conflicts before generation.

**Requirements Covered:** REQ-502

**Dependencies:** Task 3.1 (document formatter — conflicts must be included in formatted context)

**Complexity:** M

**Subtasks:**

1. Group retrieved documents by spec_id or filename stem
2. Within each group, detect version mismatches
3. Build conflict records (spec, version A, version B, dates)
4. Inject conflict warnings into the LLM context string
5. Include conflict information in the final response to the user

---

### Task 3.3: PromptTemplate Integration

**Description:** Replace raw string formatting for prompt construction with a template engine that safely handles variable injection. Documents containing curly braces (JSON, code) must not be interpreted as template variables.

**Requirements Covered:** REQ-601, REQ-602

**Dependencies:** None.

**Complexity:** S

**Subtasks:**

1. Store system prompt in a separate markdown file (no variables — static rules only)
2. Store human turn template in a separate file with named placeholders (`{documents}`, `{question}`)
3. Use a template engine (e.g., LangChain ChatPromptTemplate) that only substitutes declared variables
4. Verify that document content with `{curly_braces}` is passed through safely
5. Ensure prompt changes take effect on restart without code changes

---

### Task 3.4: Multi-Turn Context / Coreference Resolution

**Description:** Add conversation history tracking and coreference resolution to the query processing stage. Enable follow-up queries that reference prior turns.

**Requirements Covered:** REQ-103

**Dependencies:** None, but integrates with Task 2.2 (pipeline state must carry conversation history).

**Complexity:** M

**Subtasks:**

1. Define a conversation buffer (last N turns, configurable)
2. Thread conversation history through the pipeline state
3. Modify the query reformulation prompt to include recent conversation context
4. Implement coreference resolution: detect pronouns/references and resolve against prior turns
5. Optionally persist conversation state (JSON file or in-memory with TTL)

---

## Phase 4 — Performance & Observability

Make the pipeline fast and debuggable.

### Task 4.1: Connection Pooling for Vector Database

**Description:** Replace per-query connection creation with a persistent connection pool. Add health checks on startup.

**Requirements Covered:** REQ-307

**Dependencies:** None.

**Complexity:** S

**Subtasks:**

1. Create a connection pool manager (singleton or module-level)
2. Support external vector database via URL configuration (not just embedded)
3. Implement startup health check (fail-fast if DB is unreachable)
4. Implement periodic liveness checks during operation
5. Handle connection failures with reconnection logic

---

### Task 4.2: Embedding Cache (LRU)

**Description:** Add an LRU cache around the query embedding function. Identical queries return cached embeddings without recomputation.

**Requirements Covered:** REQ-306

**Dependencies:** None.

**Complexity:** S

**Subtasks:**

1. Wrap the embed_query function with an LRU cache (configurable max size)
2. Use the raw query string as cache key (normalize whitespace)
3. Ensure cache is thread-safe if concurrent queries are supported
4. Add cache hit/miss metrics for observability (REQ-802)
5. Externalize cache size to config (REQ-903)

---

### Task 4.3: Query Result Cache (TTL)

**Description:** Cache full pipeline responses keyed by `(processed_query, filters)` with a configurable TTL. Cache hits bypass all downstream stages.

**Requirements Covered:** REQ-308

**Dependencies:** None, but should be placed early in the pipeline (after query processing, before retrieval).

**Complexity:** S

**Subtasks:**

1. Define cache key: normalized `(processed_query, source_filter, heading_filter, alpha)` tuple
2. Implement TTL-based cache (dict + timestamps, or `cachetools.TTLCache`)
3. On cache hit, return cached response immediately
4. On cache miss, proceed through pipeline and store result
5. Add cache bypass flag for debugging
6. Externalize TTL and max cache size to config (REQ-903)

---

### Task 4.4: Observability Instrumentation

**Description:** Add end-to-end tracing and per-stage metrics capture for every query processed.

**Requirements Covered:** REQ-801, REQ-802, REQ-803

**Dependencies:** All pipeline stages must exist (Phases 1–3).

**Complexity:** M

**Subtasks:**

1. Choose observability backend (e.g., Langfuse, OpenTelemetry, or structured JSON logging)
2. Generate unique trace ID per query
3. Implement trace decorator/wrapper for each pipeline stage
4. Capture all metrics defined in REQ-802 (latency, scores, counts per stage)
5. Implement alerting thresholds (REQ-803) with configurable values
6. Ensure trace ID is included in the final response for debugging

---

## Phase 5 — Security

Harden the pipeline against data leakage and injection.

### Task 5.1: Externalize Injection Patterns

**Description:** Move hardcoded injection detection patterns to an external config file. Patterns are loaded at startup and applied during pre-retrieval guardrail processing.

**Requirements Covered:** REQ-202, REQ-903

**Dependencies:** Task 1.1 (pre-retrieval guardrail — this is a subtask of 1.1, broken out for clarity).

**Complexity:** S

**Subtasks:**

1. Create a YAML/JSON config file for injection patterns
2. Migrate existing hardcoded patterns to the config file
3. Load patterns at startup, compile to regex
4. Log pattern count on load for verification
5. Document the pattern format for maintainers

---

### Task 5.2: Pre-Retrieval PII Filtering

**Description:** Detect and redact PII from user queries before they are sent to external LLM APIs. Conditional on `EXTERNAL_LLM_MODE` configuration flag.

**Requirements Covered:** REQ-204

**Dependencies:** Task 1.1 (pre-retrieval guardrail — this is a subtask of 1.1, broken out for clarity).

**Complexity:** M

**Subtasks:**

1. Implement regex-based PII detection (email, phone, SSN/employee ID patterns)
2. Implement NER-based person name detection (optional, using existing entity extraction or a lightweight model)
3. Replace detected PII with typed placeholders (`[PERSON]`, `[EMAIL]`, `[PHONE]`)
4. Preserve original query internally (for retrieval against local DB — PII is fine locally)
5. Only activate when `EXTERNAL_LLM_MODE=true` in config
6. Log PII detection events (count, types) without logging the actual PII values

---

### Task 5.3: Post-Generation PII Filtering

**Description:** Detect and redact PII from generated answers before they reach the user. This runs regardless of LLM deployment mode.

**Requirements Covered:** REQ-703

**Dependencies:** Task 1.2 (post-generation guardrail — this is a subtask of 1.2, broken out for clarity).

**Complexity:** M

**Subtasks:**

1. Reuse PII detection logic from Task 5.2 (shared module)
2. Apply to the generated answer text
3. Replace PII with typed placeholders
4. Log redaction events for audit (count and type, not the PII values)
5. This filter runs on every generated answer (not conditional)
