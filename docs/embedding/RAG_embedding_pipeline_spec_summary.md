## 1) System Intent

The AION RAG Document Embedding Pipeline converts engineering documents into
semantically searchable embeddings and optional knowledge graph triples for
relationship-aware retrieval.

It targets mission-critical ASIC knowledge workflows where retrieval errors can
propagate to design mistakes. The specification defines pipeline behavior,
quality controls, fallback paths, and measurable acceptance criteria.

---

## 2) Scope and Boundaries

**Entry point:** Source document file on local filesystem (`PDF`, `DOCX`,
`PPTX`, `XLSX`, `Markdown`, `HTML`, `RST`, plain text).  
**Exit points:**  

- Vector embeddings + metadata in vector database  
- Knowledge graph triples in graph store (when enabled)

### In scope

- Document ingestion, processing, and embedding
- Vector storage with hybrid search capability (vector + keyword)
- Knowledge graph construction and storage
- Document review tier management
- Re-ingestion of updated documents
- Batch processing of document directories
- Retrieval quality evaluation framework

### Out of scope

- Query processing, reranking, and answer generation
  (downstream retrieval layer)
- User authentication and access control
- Document authoring or editing
- Real-time document change detection (push-based ingestion)

### Out of scope — broader platform (see Strategic Proposal)

- Skills repository and anti-skills validation framework
- AI-assisted documentation agents
- Code standardisation and Python migration initiative
- Web dashboard UI (Phase 3)
- Reranker model deployment and tuning (downstream retrieval layer)
- Adoption strategy, change management, and gamification

### Key Constraints

The spec defines 7 explicit assumptions (Section 1.6) that bound the operating
envelope: Python 3.11+ runtime, LangGraph/LangChain availability, accessible
vector database, LLM provider (with fallback to deterministic alternatives),
sequential document processing (no concurrent ingestion of the same document),
documents <= ~100 pages (larger documents should be pre-split), and embedding
model token limits accommodating target chunk sizes.

      Vector DB        Graph Store

      * = optional / configurable
```

All stages share a common state object (`PipelineDocument`), write bounded
outputs, and support fail-safe fallback behavior to avoid batch-halting
failures.

## 4) Requirement Framework in v2

The v2 specification is structured as a formal requirements document:

- **RFC 2119 keywords** for requirement strength (`SHALL`, `SHOULD`, `MAY`)
- **Requirement families:** `FR-*` (functional), `NFR-*` (non-functional),
  `SC-*` (security/compliance)
- **Per-requirement rationale and acceptance criteria** to support
  implementation and verification
- **Terminology, assumptions/constraints, and traceability matrix** for
  auditability

---

## 5) Functional Requirement Domains

Functional requirements cover:

- Core pipeline stages (`FR-100` to `FR-999`)
- Data model and deterministic identity (`FR-1030` to `FR-1034`)
- Quality validation (`FR-1100` to `FR-1199`)
- Storage schema, hybrid search, and schema versioning
  (`FR-1120` to `FR-1133`)
- Embedding and storage (`FR-1200` to `FR-1399`)
- Re-ingestion (`FR-1400`)
- Review tiers (`FR-1500`)
- Domain vocabulary (`FR-1600`)
- Error handling/fallback matrix (`FR-1700`)
- Configuration system (`FR-1800`)
- Interfaces: CLI and programmatic API (`FR-1900` to `FR-1952`)
- Evaluation framework (`FR-2000`)
- Feedback and continuous improvement (`FR-2100`)

---

## 6) Non-Functional and Security Themes

### Non-functional areas (`NFR-*`)

- Performance (throughput, latency, memory budgets)
- Scalability (document/chunk growth expectations)
- Reliability (graceful degradation and fallback execution)
- Maintainability (modular nodes, replaceable providers)
- Deployment (runtime, infra constraints, offline-capable operation)

### Security/compliance (`SC-*`)

- Auditability and operational traceability
- Data residency/exfiltration controls
- Credential handling requirements
- Data lifecycle and retention controls

---

## 7) Core Design Principles

- **Swappability over lock-in**: providers behind interfaces and config  
- **Fail-safe over fail-fast**: deterministic fallbacks for model failures  
- **Context preservation over compression**: no loss of technical facts  
- **Configuration-driven behavior**: stage toggles and runtime overrides  
- **Idempotency by construction**: deterministic IDs and repeatable outputs  
- **Controlled access over restriction**: ingest broadly, filter by trust tier

---

## 8) Key Decisions Captured by the Spec

- DAG-style orchestration for stage-level control and conditional routing
- Deterministic identities (hash-based) for reproducibility and
  re-ingestion safety
- Provenance-aware refactoring: refactored retrieval text with mandatory
  source-linked citation mapping
- Hybrid retrieval readiness (vector + keyword metadata support)
- Delete-and-reinsert re-ingestion strategy to avoid partial drift
- Configurable multimodal/KG/cross-reference paths with optional enablement

---

## 8.1) Refactor-Provenance Contract (Normative Intent)

When document refactoring is enabled, the pipeline still treats the original
document as source-of-truth:

- original source remains immutable,
- refactored text is treated as a derived retrieval representation,
- chunk metadata must include mapping back to original source spans,
- citations must resolve to original source URI/location, not only derived text.

This preserves retrieval quality gains from refactoring while preventing
citation drift.

---

## 9) Acceptance, Evaluation, and Feedback

The spec defines:

- **System-level acceptance criteria** (pipeline correctness/quality gates)
- **Evaluation framework requirements** (ground-truth, metrics, repeatable
  scoring)
- **Feedback loop requirements** (capture retrieval feedback and support
  iterative improvements)

Together, these ensure the pipeline is not only implemented, but measurably effective.

---

## 10) External Dependencies (High-Level)

**Required:** Vector database (e.g., Weaviate), LLM provider
(e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama)  
**Optional:** VLM provider for figure-to-text conversion, dedicated graph
database (e.g., Neo4j), observability platform (e.g., Langfuse)  
**Downstream contract only:** Reranker and answer-generation systems consume
pipeline outputs but are outside this spec's scope.
