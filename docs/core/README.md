## Overview

The inference backend subsystem provides pluggable embedding and reranking providers. A single `RAG_INFERENCE_BACKEND` env var switches between:

- **`local`** (default) — BGE models run in-process inside `rag-worker`
- **`vllm`** — Qwen3 models served by `rag-vllm-embed` and `rag-vllm-rerank` containers, routed through LiteLLM

See the [engineering guide](INFERENCE_BACKEND_ENGINEERING_GUIDE.md) for architecture, configuration reference, operational runbook, and extension instructions.
